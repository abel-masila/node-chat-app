# Node JS/Socket.io Chat App
This simple chat app uses es6 features and socket.io to allow you create/join existing rooms,chat with roommates and share your location.
There is no persistent storage like a db so once you leave the chatroom, your messages get cleared. If the room you want to join does'nt exist, we'll create one for you and add you and you tell your friends to join that room.
